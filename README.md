# webcam-based-painting
The goal is to build a webcam-based painting program in which some portion of the image (say your hand, or a marker tip) acts as a "paintbrush".  The core computational problem is to identify the paintbrush in the webcam image. Here we base the recognition solely on color, so it should have a fairly uniform and distinct color.
